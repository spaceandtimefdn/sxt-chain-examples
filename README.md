# Space and Time Chain Examples

This repository contains examples and guides for how to interact with the Space and Time Chain.

## Tutorials

There are currently two tutorials, both "Hello World" style. We recommend doing the "Create Table" tutorial first since the "Onchain Query" is querying the table created in the "Create Table" tutorial.

- [Hello World - Create Table](./tutorials/create_hello_world_table/)
- [Hello World - Onchain Query](./tutorials/onchain_hello_world_query/)
